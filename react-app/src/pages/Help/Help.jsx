              ICST (Immune Subgroup Classification of Solid Tumours) is a
              research tool for cancer researchers and immunotherapy
              practitioners developed as an MSc Software Development project by
              Jordan Poots in concert with research performed by Dr Reza Rafiee
              at Queen&apos;s University Belfast. It seeks to use FPKM
              normalised RNA-Seq data from 440 genes to group solid tumour
              samples into one of the six immune sugroups identified in the 2018

              ICST accepts FPKM normalised RNA-Seq data and extracts 440 key
              genes for the subgroup classification. Any missing genes are
              imputed using MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations).
              To ensure the quality of predictions all samples undergo Gene QC
              and samples with 10 or more missing genes will be rejected. Gene
              expression values are then scaled between 0 and 1 using a Minmax
              scaling algorithm. These &quot;features&quot; are fed to a
              supervised machine learning model trained on over 7000 samples

              The tool also uses the PCA (Principle Component Analysis)
              algorithm with standard scaling and the t-SNE (t-distributed
