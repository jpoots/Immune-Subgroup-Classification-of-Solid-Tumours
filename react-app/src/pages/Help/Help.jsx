              ICST (Immune Subgroup Classification of Solid Tumours) is a
              research tool for cancer researchers and immunotherapy
              practitioners developed as an MSc Software Development project by
              Jordan Poots in concert with research performed by Dr Reza Rafiee
              at Queen&apos;s University Belfast. It seeks to use FPKM
              normalised RNA-Seq data from 440 genes to group solid tumour
              samples into one of the six immune sugroups identified in the 2018
              publication{" "}
              <QueensLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29628290/">
                The Immune Landscape of Cancer
              </QueensLink>
              . In addition, a 7th subgroup is defined by Dr Rafiee for samples
              which fall between subgroups. Full sungroup names are listed
              below. More details about the characterists along with therapeutic
              inights can be found in the linked paper. The tool also provides
              useful visualisation tools for the data.

              ICST accepts FPKM normalised RNA-Seq data and extracts 440 key
              genes for the subgroup classification. Any missing genes are
              imputed using MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations).
              Note that the system will not accept missing gene rows. To ensure
              the quality of predictions all samples undergo Gene Quality
              Control and samples with 10 or more missing genes will be
              rejected. Gene expression values are then scaled between 0 and 1
              using a Minmax scaling algorithm. These &quot;features&quot; are
              fed to a supervised machine learning model trained on
              approximately 6000 samples from PanCanAtlas using the{" "}

              Confidence intervals are attained using models trained on 10
              random bootstraps of the training data. Note that this is for
              demonstration purposes only. A larger number of bootstraps should
              be used in production. Prediction probabilities are generated from
              each of these models and a confidence interval is extracted. This
              is shown via a box plot where the box indicates the true range of
              the probability with a confidence of the requested interval. For
              example, a box ranging from 0.95 - 0.9 for a 95% interval
              indicates the system is 95% sure that the true proability is in

            The genes may be in any order and a file may contain more than the
            440 required genes. A label row/column should be included for both
            axis. In addition, to maintain accuracy, any samples for which ICST
            cannot make a confident prediction will be deemed non-classifiable
            (NC). The current threshold for this is 92%. Where samples fall
            below this threshold but above a random guess (50%) and have a top
            two probabilities which sum to a value above the threshold, they are
            deemed to have two predominant subgroups and are labelled as
            subgroup 7 in the classification table. Results and visualisations
